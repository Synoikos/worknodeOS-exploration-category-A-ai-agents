**When Phase 2 complete**: Mark "Phase 2" above as [x] and move to Phase 3

---

## 🔗 PHASE 3: CROSS-FILE SYNTHESIS

Create `analysis/SYNTHESIS.md` with:

- [ ] Common themes across files
- [ ] Convergent recommendations (multiple files suggesting same thing)
- [ ] Contradictions/conflicts that need resolution
- [ ] Synergies between different proposals
- [ ] Implementation readiness assessment
- [ ] Research gaps identified

**When Phase 3 complete**: Mark "Phase 3" above as [x] and move to Phase 4

---

## ❓ PHASE 4: RESEARCH QUESTIONS

Create `analysis/CATEGORY_H_RESEARCH_QUESTIONS.md`:

- [ ] Generate 5-10 P0 questions (v1.0 blockers)
- [ ] Generate 10-15 P1 questions (v1.0 enhancements)
- [ ] Generate 10-15 P2 questions (v2.0 roadmap)
- [ ] Generate 5-10 P3 questions (long-term research)
- [ ] Ensure each question has: ID, priority, effort, dependencies, approach, outcome, relevance

**Target**: 30-50 total questions

**When Phase 4 complete**: Mark "Phase 4" above as [x] and move to Phase 5

---

## 📝 PHASE 5: FINAL ASSEMBLY

Combine all individual analyses into `analysis/CATEGORY_H_ANALYSIS.md`:

- [ ] Copy/paste Executive Summaries from all file analyses
- [ ] Create category-level executive summary (300-500 lines)
- [ ] Add cross-file synthesis from SYNTHESIS.md
- [ ] Add category-level stringent criteria summary
- [ ] Create integration roadmap (Phase 1-4)
- [ ] Add recommendations section
- [ ] Verify total length: 1,500-2,500 lines
- [ ] Run final completion checklist from README.md

**When Phase 5 complete**: Mark "Phase 5" above as [x]

---

## 💾 COMMIT STRATEGY

**After each phase**, commit your progress:

```bash
git add analysis/
git add PROGRESS.md
git commit -m "Category H: Completed Phase [N]"
git push
```

This ensures work is saved incrementally and can be resumed across sessions.

---

## 🔄 RESUMING WORK IN NEW SESSION

When starting a new Claude Code session:

1. **Read PROGRESS.md** - See what's already done
2. **Check analysis/ directory** - See what files exist
3. **Continue from current phase** - Pick up where previous session left off
4. **Update checkboxes** - Mark items complete as you go
5. **Commit frequently** - Save progress after each file or phase

---

## 📋 SESSION LOG

Track which sessions worked on this category:

- Session 1: [Date] - Phase(s) completed:
- Session 2: [Date] - Phase(s) completed:
- Session 3: [Date] - Phase(s) completed:

(Update this as you work)
